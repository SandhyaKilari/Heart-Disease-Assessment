# Heart-Disease-Assessment

This project is very important because it deals with a serious health problem that affects many people. Heart disease is one of the top reasons why people die worldwide, and finding it early is crucial for helping patients get better and reducing the cost of healthcare. By using data science and machine learning, we have a chance to create a tool that can save lives and make people more aware of their health. This project helps individuals, doctors, and society as a whole by giving them a useful way to understand and manage the risk of heart disease.

It allows users to input their health information and receive an estimate of their risk for heart disease. It could also provide educational resources and recommendations for heart disease prevention and management.
